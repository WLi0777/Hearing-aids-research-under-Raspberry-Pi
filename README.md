<summary><h2>About</h2></summary>

Existing hearing aid auditory frameworks provide basic sound amplification and crude noise filtering capabilities, limiting their growth in the existing AI technology market. 
This research results in increased hearing aid processing power and programmability for more sophisticated processing strategies to improve the quality of sound delivered to the impaired ear.

- ***What is included***: [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), [ReSpeaker 4-MIC Array](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array_for_Raspberry_Pi/), Headphone (Output), Screen, Remote controller
- ***What is new***: The core technical difference between the hearing aids studied in this experiment and ordinary hearing aids is the processing method inside the chip for the sound signals collected in by the microphone. 
- ***What will build***: Raspberry Pi-based hearing aids can be extended with software-controlled features to include Alexa voice assistant, sound source location and tracking, noise reduction, binaural processing, reverberation cancellation.
